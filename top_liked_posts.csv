2022-12-22 18:12:11+00:00,126,i can only hope to someday attain the level of patience the person running nasas social media has
2021-11-01 15:42:25+00:00,120,you are being gaslighted have any of you heard at any time how the science of global temperature is measured probably not which is why its so easy for nasa to fool you they believe it themselves its been so successful a campaign you all look at weather which is chaotic and always has been you just hear more about it so you think its a real problem appeal to authority is a logical fallacy and this subject is rife with it check out some of the opposing thought on the subject mostly by scientist that no longer have anything to lose professors emeritus retired climate scientists they tell the truth the orbit of jupiter has more to do with our climate than carbon and the sun is the major factor along with water vapor plants die at  ppm carbon and  ppm is no big deal we have had ice ages with carbon at ppm do your own research people
2021-09-22 22:11:46+00:00,110,i love watch nasa dunk on people who think they can debunk climate change
2021-10-31 19:15:08+00:00,62,too bad we dont see oct  or  just keep going back and you will find the medieval warming period peak as high as we are now back well before the little ice age
2022-12-22 17:13:44+00:00,55,to those who cite a very cold day as evidence against global warming stephen colbert once said and world hunger is over because i just ate lunch
2022-10-26 16:40:49+00:00,54,im kinda surprised that the trolls blaming earths natural cycles havent already chimed in
2023-12-14 16:17:28+00:00,46,waiting for the science illiterates to come tell us how its all a scam because math and chemistry eludes them
2021-09-23 15:30:24+00:00,43,its worth remembering that land surfaces red in the graph below warm at about twice the rate of global mean temperature rise green and the arctic is warming around three times faster than the global mean  so c of global warming would mean c of average warming on land and c in the arctic  these are huge changes over the space of a human lifetime and we would struggle to adapt  best to do something about it soonish
2022-12-22 16:55:06+00:00,43,thank you for the research you do and for sticking to the science when people want it politicize it
2022-09-07 17:29:49+00:00,40,i find it interesting when people claim that co cant possibly be the cause of the earth warming because it is just a trace gas yet the same people would acknowledge that this trace gas is responsible for all plant life on earth
